    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>
        There are many ways to make potato salad, but if you're looking for a traditional, mayonnaise-based potato salad made with hard-boiled eggs, celery, and a little pickle relish for zing.
    </p>
    <p>
        The kind of potatoes you use will affect the texture of your potato salad. Here are some guidelines to help you choose the best potatoes for potato salad so you get the results you're looking for.

        Waxy potatoes, like red potatoes and fingerling potatoes, have a smooth texture and will hold their shape even after boiling. And with their thin, delicate skins, they might not even need peeling. Use waxy potatoes if you like firm potatoes in your potato salad.
        Starchy potatoes, like Idahos or Russets, break down when they're boiled but their starchy texture soaks up dressing beautifully. Use starchy potatoes if you like softer creamier potatoes in your potato salad, but you'll have to peel them because of their thicker skins.
        All-purpose potatoes, like Yukon Golds, hit the sweet spot between waxy and starchy potatoes, and are reliable choices for potato salad.

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li> 5 Potatoes: It's not potato salad without potatoes. The recipe doesn't specify what size potatoes or what kind, so choose medium-size potatoes, or enough to serve eight.</li>
            <li>3 Eggs: Hard-boiled eggs are a must-have for this kind of old-fashioned potato salad, but you can leave them out if you really want to/li>
            <li>1 cup chopped Celery: Celery adds a crunchy element to balance the softer texture and creaminess of the potatoes.</li>
            <li>1/2 cup chopped Onion: You can use any onion you like, including yellow, white, or red onions. Chop the onion into small, uniform pieces so no one bites into a big chunk of raw onion
            </li>
            <li>1/2 cup of sweet pickle Relish: Use your favorite sweet pickle relish. Some reviewers chopped up sweet gherkin pickles, or substitute relish or pickles that are less sweet.</li> 
            <li>1/4 cup Mayonnaise: This is the creamy element that brings all the ingredients together. For best results, mix the mayonnaise, mustard, relish, and seasonings together in a separate bowl. Give it a taste test and adjust the seasonings before adding to the potatoes, eggs, and onion.</li> 
            <li>1 tablespoon prepared Mustard: Use your favorite mustard. Some reviewers like to use yellow mustard and some prefer Dijon.</li> 
            <li>Seasonings: This recipe calls for 1/4 teaspoon of garlic salt, 1/4 teaspoon of celery salt, and ground black pepper to taste; some reviewers added extras like paprika and garlic powder. You can add minced herbs, too, like dill, chives, parsley, and tarragon, with black pepper to taste.</li>
