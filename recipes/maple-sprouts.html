    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>Brussels sprouts with bacon are roasted in a mixture of maple syrup and olive oil, resulting in a crispy, caramelized side dish that's quick and easy to make and perfect for weeknight dinners. The Brussels sprouts take on a nutty flavor during the roasting process, and the salty bacon is a delightful contrast with the sweet maple syrup â€” who knew Brussels sprouts with bacon could ever taste this good?</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Brussels sprouts: Start with a pound of whole, clean, and trimmed Brussels sprouts.</li>
            <li>Bacon: Roast the bacon pieces with the sprouts until they're perfectly crispy.</li>
            <li>Seasonings: These Brussels sprouts with bacon are simply seasoned with just salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Oil: Olive oil keeps the sprouts moist and gives the seasonings something to adhere to.
            </li>
            <li>Maple syrup: Pure maple syrup adds sweet flavor to the otherwise savory side dish. It's the perfect way to round out the other ingredients.</li> 
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
